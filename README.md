This project is the submission for the Pilot AI program, I have chosen the Banking Fraud project, which is described below.

## Banking Fraud
Every year, billions of banking transactions occur in the United States. While only a small portion of those are fraudulent, the results can be devastating is a fraudulent transaction is not discovered. Costs include damage to the customer, to the company, and to regulator agencies tasked with confirming validity of payments. 

## Fraud Detection 
The task is to design a system capable of automatically catching fraudulent transactions. A variety of approaches can be used to evaluate. There will be labeled data, to allow a design of a classification approach. The challenge will be finding the right model, or combinations of models, that detect the most fraudulent transactions.
